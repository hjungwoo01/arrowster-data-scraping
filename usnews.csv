All BYU students can participate in the intramural sports, and about 40% choose to do so. Freshmen do not have to live on the Provo, Utah, campus, though the school encourages it. All students live according to a strict honor code, which prohibits – among other things – camping with members of the opposite sex and growing a beard without a doctor's approval. Extramarital and gay sex are also prohibited. Situated at the base of the Wasatch Mountains, the campus is close to plentiful climbing, hiking and biking opportunities.

The Greek system constitutes a large part of campus life, with about a third of the student body involved in nearly 50 fraternities and sororities. In fact, the school often gets the moniker “Mother of Fraternities” because the Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Kappa Tau and Sigma Chi organizations were founded at Miami University. The school is also known as the ""Cradle of Coaches"" for the number of professional and collegiate coaches who once competed for Miami. The RedHawks, who compete in the Division I Mid-American Conference, were known as the Redskins until 1997. The name was changed after years of controversy and a request from the Miami Indian Tribe. (The tribe is the namesake of the university.) To help ease the transition into freshman year, older students often create a guide to life at Miami University, called the ""M Book."" Student couples who marry are known as ""Miami Mergers"" and are reminded of their alma mater each Valentine's Day, when the admissions office sends cards to congratulate former students on finding love at school.","$38,127","16,865","(out-of-state)","(tie)","Tuition and Fees","$17,055","(in-state)","Tuition","(fall 2022)"
