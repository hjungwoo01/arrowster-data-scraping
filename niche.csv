Would highly recommend going on On-The-Loose trips, where you can go on backpacking trips, overnight beach trips, etc. Pomona has been the perfect fit, and I couldn't ask for a better college experience.

UCLA just presents a lot of diversity in terms of the experiences that you can have. You can get your party fix in on Thursdays at frat row, kickbacks through cultural or professional organizations, or even a warehouse rave in the Arts District. Academically, there are plenty of opportunities for research and internships. It can be difficult to get into certain classes until you are in your 3rd or 4th year, though. Living on campus is really helpful for finding friends and the food is definitely a blow-out compared to other schools I've visited. Only downside is that housing in general is expensive due to the area, so you'll likely be sharing a room and living on a budget!","Alum:","...","Read 5,609 reviews","A+","grade","Overall Niche Grade","Acceptance rate 9%","Net price $16,999","SAT range —","#19 Best Colleges in America.","University of California - Los Angeles","Blue checkmark.","4 Year,","LOS ANGELES, CA,","5609 Niche users give it an average review of 4 stars.","Featured Review: Alum says","As with any college, the experience is what you make of it.

What I did not realize were the many factors that came along with starting this new path of life -- living away from home, party culture, the football game frenzy, endless schoolwork, and the underlying pressure of having to make connections and network with others. Although these aspects seemed as though they were going to slowly but surely destroy me, I found great solace in studying (and the occasional bi-weekly matcha latte from Sweetwaters:)). The vast amount of resources in any field from ballet to biochemistry was something truly unique and a gift for someone interested in a multidisciplinary career like me. Further the research opportunities available to even first year students were abundant in every field. One thing I would like to see change is the resources available for people struggling to make friends and find a community.

There is a lot of traditions that are fun to participate in such as hockey games and slope day. The academics can be really stressful and a bit overwhelming especially if you have other big time commitments outside of school but it's really helped me become more prepared for internships and life outside campus if I'm being honest. I've made a lot of good friends here and people are generally nice, although there is definetely some cliqueness in some groups. A lot of people say Ithaca/location of the school aren't ideal but for me it's perfect as I grew up surrounded by nature and Cornell gives a lot of access to outdoor activities like rock climbing, hiking, and biking to name a few. It also gets really pretty during fall, spring, and snows but the winter kind of drags on which is pretty frustrating especially if you're not used to having cold winters.","Junior:","...","Read 2,088 reviews","A+","grade","Overall Niche Grade","Acceptance rate 7%","Net price $26,060","SAT range 1470-1570","#22 Best Colleges in America.","Cornell University","Blue checkmark.","4 Year,","ITHACA, NY,","2088 Niche users give it an average review of 3.8 stars.","Featured Review: Junior says","I am currently a junior and really enjoy my time at Cornell so far.
